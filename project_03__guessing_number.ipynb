        "\n",
        "This code implements a number guessing game where the computer tries to guess a number that the user is thinking of, based on the user's feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps**\n",
        "*1. User Input for Range:* The program prompts the user to define a range (lower and upper limits) for the number they are thinking of. It checks if the input values are valid integers and ensures the lower limit is less than the upper limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*2. Game Process:* The computer starts guessing the number by picking the midpoint of the range. It then asks the user if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*3. Feedback Handling:* Based on user feedback (high, low, correct), the program adjusts the range and continues guessing. It also provides hints after every 5 incorrect guesses to encourage the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*4. Game End: *The game continues until the computer guesses the correct number, at which point it displays a congratulatory message, including the number of attempts taken to guess it.\n",

        "Interactive feedback loop for the user.\n",
